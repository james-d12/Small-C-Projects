# What Is It?
This is my personal linear algebra library, made entirely using only C and Shell scripting. It is designed to be used by other developers, in larger more grand applications, to shave off development times for common functions and structures used in linear algebra calculations. It currently provides only operations for matrices and vectors, linear functions and solvers have not been implemented yet.

## Features
  - **Matrix Creation**: Contains functions for creating matrices of all varying dimensions.
  - **Vector Creation**: Contains functions for creating vectors of all varying dimensions.
  - **Matrix Math**: Currently, contains basic mathematical functions such as add,subtract,multiply, tranpose, etc.
  - **Vector Math**: Currently contains basic mathematical functions (basic operations, +,-,*,/) along with magnitude, normalise,     
  and more.
  - **Matrix Comparison**: Contains functions for determining what type a matrix is - symmetric, triangular (upper/lower),       
  diagonal, identity, etc.
  - **Vector Comparison**: Contains functions for determining if 2 vectors are equal, not equal, along with determining if some      
  vectors are coplanar, collinear, etc.
  - **Tests**: Contains basic tests for these functions, which also act as a mini 'example' of how to use each feature.
